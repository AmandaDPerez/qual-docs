Unlike quantitative research, which seeks to quantify data and generalize results from sample populations to larger populations, qualitative research focuses on understanding human experiences from a holistic perspective. This chapter introduces the core principles and methodologies of qualitative research, setting the stage for a deeper dive into open coding in subsequent chapters.\n\n## **Understanding Qualitative Research**\n\nQualitative research is a method of inquiry employed in several different academic disciplines, traditionally in the social sciences, but also in market research and further contexts. It aims to gather an in-depth understanding of human behavior and the factors that dictate such behavior. The qualitative method investigates the why and how of decision making, not just what, where, when. Hence, smaller but focused samples are more often needed, rather than large samples.\n\n### **Key Characteristics of Qualitative Research**\n\n-   **In-depth Exploration**: Focuses on exploring phenomena in detail and depth.\n\n-   **Contextual Understanding**: Considers the context in which the data is collected.\n\n-   **Subjective Interpretation**: Emphasizes subjective meanings and interpretations of participants.\n\n-   **Flexibility**: Allows for changes and new questions to emerge during the research process.\n\n## **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research**\n\nWhile both qualitative and quantitative research are valuable in understanding various phenomena, they differ fundamentally in objectives, approaches, and outcomes.\n\n-   **Objective**: Quantitative research aims to quantify data and generalize results. In contrast, qualitative research seeks to understand the complexity of human experience.\n\n-   **Approach**: Quantitative research often uses structured tools such as surveys and statistics, whereas qualitative research uses semi-structured or unstructured techniques like interviews and observations.\n\n-   **Outcome**: Quantitative research results in numerical data, while qualitative research produces rich, narrative data.\n\n## **Key Principles of Qualitative Research**\n\nQualitative research is guided by several key principles that shape its practice:\n\n-   **Naturalistic Inquiry**: Research is conducted in natural settings where phenomena occur.\n\n-   **Researcher as Key Instrument**: The researcher plays a crucial role in data collection and analysis, bringing in their subjective interpretation.\n\n-   **Multiple Perspectives**: Emphasizes the importance of looking at situations and events from multiple viewpoints to gain a comprehensive understanding.\n\n-   **Emergent Design Flexibility**: The research design can evolve as the study progresses.\n\n-   **Holistic Perspective**: Seeks to understand phenomena as whole systems rather than through the analysis of parts.\n\n## **Overview of Qualitative Research Methods**\n\nThere are various methods used in qualitative research to collect and analyze data:\n\n-   **Interviews**: Personal interviews or focus groups to gather deep insights.\n\n-   **Observations**: Direct observation of behaviors and events in their natural context.\n\n-   **Document and Content Analysis**: Examination of texts, media, and other forms of content to understand themes and patterns.\n\n-   **Case Studies**: In-depth study of a single case or multiple cases within a real-world context.\n\n## **The Role of Theory in Qualitative Research**\n\nTheory plays a dual role in qualitative research. It can be both a starting point for investigation and an outcome. Researchers may begin with a theoretical framework to guide their inquiry but remain open to modifying or generating new theories based on their findings. This iterative relationship between theory and data is a hallmark of qualitative research.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"ch1.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
